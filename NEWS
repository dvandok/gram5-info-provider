* News for version 0.2

  This is the second unrelease of the gram-info-provider package. This
  version brings the GLUE 2 schema scripts, reworked from the existing
  CREAM scripts. Some of the scripts are refactored to output ldif data
  via Net::LDAP::LDIF instead of via print statements.

  Many corners were cut so the output of these scripts must not be taken
  as production ready. Also lacking are documentation and more safety
  checks for errors.

* News for version 0.1

  This is the initial unrelease of the gram-info-provider package that
  brings GLUE schema compliant Grid Information System data to the
  GRAM5 compute element.  This version is still very experimental, and
  only outputs GLUE 1.3 compatible data modeled after the analogue
  scripts for the CREAM compute element of EMI.

  The information sources has been reworked from a collection of shell
  variables and configuration scripts called YAIM into a much simpler
  collection of INI-style configuration files.

  The scripts have been written in Legible Perl(TM) and make use of an
  external module for reading and parsing the configuration files.
